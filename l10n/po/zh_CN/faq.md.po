msgid "Think of Quarkus extensions as your project dependencies. Extensions configure, boot and integrate a framework or technology into your Quarkus application. They also do all of the heavy lifting of providing the right information to GraalVM for your application to compile natively. This will allow 3rd party projects to easily take advantage of the work we have done to make it easier to target GraalVM.\n"

We are working as we speak to allow an extension to be published in separate repos and separate GAVs and thus published in Maven repos independently of Quarkus core. This will greatly simplify the publication process. Expect news soon.\n"

We have a maturity model to improve an extension to be fully \"Quarked\" and benefit from Quarkus, all done in incremental steps. Just hop on our [mailing list](https://quarkus.io/community/#discussions) to discuss your ideas and get help. And you can start reading our [Writing extensions guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions) as well or more simply get inspiration from the [existing ones](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/extensions).\n"

msgid "[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in various different languages, as well as providing the ability to compile JVM bytecode to a native executable (this native executable runs a special virtual machine called SubstrateVM). These native executables start much faster and can use a lot less memory than a traditional JVM, however not every JVM feature is supported, and some are more limited than normal.\n"

msgid "For example by default reflection in GraalVM will not work, unless a class/member has been explicitly registered for reflection. This is normally achieved by listing every class, method, field and constructor in a JSON file, and passing this as a parameter into the native image build. This obviously gets quite cumbersome for all but the most trivial projects. Quarkus provides a framework that makes it easy to work around these annotations, and programmatically determine what should be registered.\n"
