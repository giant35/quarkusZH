msgid "For years, the client-server architecture has been the de-facto standard to build applications.  But a significant shift happened.  The _one model rules them all_ age is over.  A new range of applications and architectural styles have emerged and transformed how code is written and how applications are deployed and executed.  HTTP microservices, reactive applications, event-driven architecture, and serverless are now central players in modern systems."
