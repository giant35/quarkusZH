msgid "As much processing as possible is done at build time; thus, your application only contains the classes used at runtime.  In traditional frameworks, all the classes required to perform the initial application deployment hang around for the application's life, even though they are only used once.  With {project-name}, they are not even loaded into the production JVM! {project-name} does not stop here.  During the build-time processing, it prepares the initialization of all components used by your application.  It results in less memory usage and faster startup time as all metadata processing has already been done."

During the built-time processing, extensions can analyze the application code and the classes available on the classpath and replace reflection calls with regular invocations.  The usage of dynamic proxies is also prevented by using generating custom proxy at build time."

msgid "GraalVM Native Executable support has been an essential part of the design for {project-name} from the beginning.  When an application is compiled down to a native executable, it starts much faster and can run with a much smaller heap than a standard JVM.  The native compiler uses aggressive dead-code elimination techniques to only embed the parts of the JVM and classes that are absolutely required by your application.  {project-name} makes building optimized native executables plain easy.  The build-time approach allows {project-name} to collect enough metadata on your application to fine-tune the compilation.  No `-H:+ReportUnsupportedElementsAtRuntime` flag, no fallback, no compromise!"

Runtime capabilities such as health checks and metrics are exposed out of the box.  {project-name} collects all the required metadata at build time to create the Kubernetes deployment descriptor and produce a container image.  A single command line can deploy your application onto your Kubernetes cluster."
