msgid "Mandrel releases are built from a code base derived from the upstream Oracle GraalVM CE code base, with only minor changes but some significant exclusions that are not necessary for Quarkus native apps.  They support the same capabilities to build native executables as Oracle GraalVM CE, with no significant changes to functionality.  Notably, they do not include support for polyglot programming.  The reason for these exclusions is to provide a better level of support for the majority of Quarkus users.  These exclusions also mean Mandrel offers a considerable reduction in its distribution size when compared with Oracle GraalVM CE/EE."

msgid "Mandrel is built slightly differently to Oracle GraalVM CE, using the standard OpenJDK project.  This means that it does not profit from a few small enhancements that Oracle have added to the version of OpenJDK used to build their own GraalVM downloads.  This enhancements are omitted because upstream OpenJDK does not manage them, and cannot vouch for.  This is particularly important when it comes to conformance and security."

msgid "Mandrel is only available for projects that can be compiled with Java 11.  If you are using Java 8, you should consider using Oracle GraalVM instead.  The reason for not using Java 8 is because it's a legacy release, which most Quarkus users are unlikely to need."

msgid "Mandrel is currently only recommended for building native executables that target Linux containerized environments.  This means that Mandrel users should use containers to build their native executables.  If you are building native executables for macOS or Windows target platforms, you should consider using Oracle GraalVM instead, because Mandrel does not currently target these platforms.  Building native executables directly on bare metal Linux is possible, with details available in the https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/blob/master/README-Mandrel.md[Mandrel README] and https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/releases[Mandrel releases]."
