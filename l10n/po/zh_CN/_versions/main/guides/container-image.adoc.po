msgid "The extension `quarkus-container-image-jib` is powered by https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] for performing container image builds.  The major benefit of using Jib with Quarkus is that all the dependencies (everything found under `target/lib`) are cached in a different layer than the actual application making rebuilds really fast and small (when it comes to pushing).  Another important benefit of using this extension is that it provides the ability to create a container image without having to have any dedicated client side tooling (like Docker) or running daemon processes (like the Docker daemon)  when all that is needed is the ability to push to a container image registry."

msgid "In situations where all that is needed to build a container image and no push to a registry is necessary (essentially by having set `quarkus.container-image.build=true` and left `quarkus.container-image.push` unset - it defaults to `false`), then this extension creates a container image and registers it with the Docker daemon. This means that although Docker isn't used to build the image, it is nevertheless necessary. Also note that using this mode, the built container image *will* show up when executing `docker images`."

msgid "There are cases when additional files (other than ones produced by the Quarkus build) need to be added to a container image.  To support these cases, Quarkus copies any file under `src/main/jib` into the built container image (which is essentially the same idea that the Jib Maven and Gradle plugins support).  For example, the presence of `src/main/jib/foo/bar` would result in `/foo/bar` being added into the container filesystem."

There are a few ways to achieve this, but they all rely on the fact that in the `container-image-jib` you can control the entrypoint to use for the container image.  By default, the container-image is created with a minimal `java -jar ...` style entrypoint, but that can be changed using the `quarkus.jib.jvm-entrypoint` configuration option."
