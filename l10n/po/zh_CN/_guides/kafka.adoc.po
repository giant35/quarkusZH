The connector will be marked as unhealthy if a message associated with a record is not acknowledged in `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` (default: 60000 ms).  Indeed, this strategy cannot commit the offset as soon as a single record processing fails (see <<error-handling>> to configure what happens on failing processing).  If `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` is set to less than or equal to `0`, it does not perform any health check verification.

msgid "Inside a consumer group, as new group members arrive and old members leave, the partitions are re-assigned so that each member receives a proportional share of the partitions.  This is known as rebalancing the group.  To handle offset commit and assigned partitions yourself, you can provide a consumer rebalance listener.  To achieve this, implement the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` interface and expose it as a CDI bean with the `@Idenfier` qualifier.  A common use case is to store offset in a separate data store to implement exactly-once semantic, or starting the processing at a specific offset."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_guides/kafka.adoc:451
msgid "The listener is invoked every time the consumer topic/partition assignment changes.  For example, when the application starts, it invokes the `partitionsAssigned` callback with the initial set of topics/partitions associated with the consumer.  If, later, this set changes, it calls the `partitionsRevoked` and `partitionsAssigned` callbacks again, so you can implement custom logic."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
